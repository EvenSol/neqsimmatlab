NeqSim for Matlab
NeqSim is an abbreviation for Non-equilibrium Simulator. It is a tool for thermodynamic and fluid-mechanic simulations. 
NeqSim enables simulation of the most common unit operations you find in the petroleum industry. 
The basis for NeqSim is a library of fundamental mathematical models related to phase behavior and physical properties of oil and gas.  NeqSim is easilly extended with new methods.
NeqSim is built upon six base modules:
1. Thermodynamic Routines
2. Physical Properties Routines
3. Fluid Mechanic Routines
4. Unit Operations
5. Chemical Reactions Routines
6. Parameter Fitting Routines
